<p>In virtualized data centers, virtual disk images (VDIs) serve as the containers in virtual environment, so their access
performance is critical for the overall system performance. Some distributed VDI chunk storage systems have been proposed in order to alleviate the I/O bottleneck for VM management. As the system scales up to a large number of running VMs, however, the overall network traffic would become unbalanced with hot spots on some VMs inevitably, leading to I/O performance degradation when accessing the VMs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and collaborative VDI storage system (ACStor) to resolve the above performance issue. In comparison to the existing research, our solution is able to dynamically balance the traffic workloads in accessing VDI chunks, based on the run-time network state. Specifically, compute nodes with lightly loaded traffic will be adaptively assigned more chunk access requests from remote VMs and vice versa, which can effectively eliminate the above problem and thus improves the I/O performance of VMs.</p>
